    "# Introduction to Recursion\n",
    "\n",
    "## Video Summary\n",
    "This video (from the \"Strivers A2Z DSA Course\" by take U forward) is the first lesson on **Recursion**. It introduces the basic concept of recursion in a beginner-friendly way using simple examples. The video explains what recursion is, why we need a stopping condition (base case), what happens during function calls, and introduces important ideas like the **recursion tree** and **stack space**.\n",

    "### Key Points Explained in the Video\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **What is Recursion?**\n",
    "   - Recursion happens when a **function calls itself**.\n",
    "      - It keeps calling itself until a certain condition is met (this condition is called the **base case**).\n",
    "\n",
    "      2. **Simple Example: Printing \"1\" infinitely**\n",
    "         - If you write a function that prints \"1\" and then calls itself again without any stop condition, it will print forever.\n",
    "            - This leads to **infinite recursion** and eventually a **stack overflow** error (the program runs out of memory).\n",
    "\n",
    "            3. **Why Stack Overflow Happens**\n",
    "               - Every time a function is called, it is pushed onto a **call stack** (a special area in memory).\n",
    "                  - When the function finishes, it is popped off the stack.\n",
    "                     - In infinite recursion, functions keep getting pushed but never pop → stack fills up → crash.\n",
